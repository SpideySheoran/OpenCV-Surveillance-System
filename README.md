# OpenCV-Surveillance-System
Detects human movement in security surveillance footage and lists out the timestamp whenever there was movement detected.

Due to lack of a better haarcascade data, the accuracy is a bit low than required.

I have also tried background subtraction anfd frame differencing techniques, but had some issues with that.
I would like to learn to implement those techniques better, hence any constructive feedback is welcome :)

To check the model, add a footage file(video format) in the same directory as the notebook and run the code
